# Inflation Trend Analysis: Pakistan & Selected South Asian Countries

## Project Overview

This project analyzes inflation trends using World Bank Consumer Price
Index (CPI) data and Python.

The analysis focuses primarily on Pakistan and compares inflation trends
across selected South Asian countries to identify important economic
patterns and differences.

The selected countries are:

- Pakistan
- India
- Bangladesh
- Sri Lanka
- Nepal

The analysis covers the period from **2000 to 2025**.

---

## Objectives

- Analyze inflation trends over time
- Identify periods of high inflation
- Compare inflation across selected countries
- Explore relationships between economic indicators
- Generate meaningful economic insights

---

## Dataset

**Source:** World Bank

**Indicator:** Consumer Price Index (2010 = 100)

**Indicator Code:** `FP.CPI.TOTL`

**Countries:** Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal

**Period:** 2000–2025

The dataset provides annual Consumer Price Index values. Annual
inflation rates were calculated from the year-over-year percentage
change in CPI.

### Inflation Calculation

The annual inflation rate was calculated as:

Inflation (%) = ((CPI_t - CPI_(t-1)) / CPI_(t-1)) × 100

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading

The World Bank CPI dataset was loaded into Python using Pandas.

### 2. Data Cleaning

The dataset was inspected and cleaned before analysis. Unnecessary
columns were removed and the required countries and years were selected.

### 3. Data Transformation

The original World Bank dataset was converted from wide format to long
format using Pandas `melt()`.

### 4. Inflation Calculation

Year-over-year percentage changes in CPI were calculated to obtain annual
inflation rates.

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis

The analysis examined:

- Inflation trends over time
- Average inflation
- Inflation volatility
- Minimum and maximum inflation
- High-inflation years
- Country-level differences

### 6. Pakistan-Focused Analysis

Pakistan was analyzed separately to identify periods of particularly
high inflation.

### 7. Cross-Country Comparison

Inflation trends were compared across Pakistan, India, Bangladesh,
Sri Lanka, and Nepal.

### 8. Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis was used to examine whether inflation rates across
the selected countries tended to move together.

## Key Findings

### Average Inflation

Pakistan recorded the highest average inflation among the selected
countries at approximately **9.47%** during the study period.

Average inflation by country:

| Country | Average Inflation |
|---|---:|
| Pakistan | 9.47% |
| Sri Lanka | 9.08% |
| Bangladesh | 6.91% |
| Nepal | 6.30% |
| India | 6.03% |

### Inflation Volatility

Sri Lanka recorded the highest inflation volatility, with a standard
deviation of approximately **10.20**, followed by Pakistan at **6.55**.

This indicates that Sri Lanka experienced substantially larger
year-to-year fluctuations in inflation during the study period.

### Highest Inflation Episodes

| Country | Peak Inflation | Year |
|---|---:|---:|
| Sri Lanka | 49.72% | 2022 |
| Pakistan | 30.77% | 2023 |
| India | 11.99% | 2010 |
| Bangladesh | 11.40% | 2011 |
| Nepal | 11.09% | 2009 |

### Pakistan

Pakistan experienced several periods of double-digit inflation.

The highest inflation rate occurred in **2023 at approximately 30.77%**.

Other major high-inflation years included:

- 2008 — 20.29%
- 2009 — 13.65%
- 2010 — 12.94%
- 2011 — 11.92%
- 2019 — 10.58%
- 2022 — 19.87%
- 2024 — 12.63%

The analysis shows that Pakistan experienced several distinct
high-inflation episodes rather than consistently high inflation
throughout the entire period.

---

## Economic Interpretation

The analysis demonstrates substantial differences in inflation patterns
across the selected South Asian economies.

Pakistan had the highest average inflation in the comparison, while Sri
Lanka experienced the greatest inflation volatility and the highest
inflation peak.

The timing and magnitude of inflation peaks also differed across
countries. This suggests that inflation patterns were influenced by both
broader regional conditions and country-specific economic factors.

The correlation analysis indicates that inflation movements were
positively related for some country pairs. However, correlation does not
imply causation.

Further analysis using additional economic indicators such as exchange
rates, food prices, energy prices, interest rates, GDP growth, and money
supply could provide deeper insight into the potential drivers of
inflation.

## Visualizations

The project includes visualizations showing:

- Inflation trends across selected countries
- Pakistan's inflation trend
- Average inflation by country
- Inflation volatility by country
- High-inflation periods
- Correlation between country inflation rates

---

## Limitations

- The analysis focuses primarily on CPI and inflation trends and does
  not directly identify the causes of inflation.
- Only five South Asian countries were selected.
- Correlation analysis identifies relationships but does not establish
  causation.
- Differences in economic structures, policies, and data availability
  may affect cross-country comparisons.
- Additional economic indicators would be required for a more detailed
  investigation of inflation drivers.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to transform real-world
economic data into meaningful insights.

Using World Bank CPI data, the analysis calculated annual inflation rates
and examined inflation trends across Pakistan, India, Bangladesh,
Sri Lanka, and Nepal from 2000 to 2025.

The analysis found that Pakistan had the highest average inflation among
the selected countries, while Sri Lanka experienced the greatest
inflation volatility and the highest inflation peak.

The project combines **data analysis skills with economic
interpretation**, demonstrating the application of Python, Pandas,
NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to a real-world economic problem.
